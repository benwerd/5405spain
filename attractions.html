                producer of California Champagnes, but what you might not know is that it is also the founder of the

                The secret is: as well as at the taproom in Santa Rosa, you can also get it at Korbel's shaded vineyard in Guerneville.

                It's all so close that it's easy to visit a winery in the early afternoon, enjoy a sunny drive along
                the Sonoma Coast, and watch the sun go down over the Pacific Ocean in the evening, before heading back 
                <a href="/">to the house</a> to finish off the night under bright stars in the backyard.
